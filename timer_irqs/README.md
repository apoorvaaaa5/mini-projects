# Timer Interrupts
This project demonstrates how to configure and handle timer interrupts on a RISC-V processor, specifically using the Ibex core integrated with the Cyancore platform. The example showcases a bare-metal implementation in which a machine timer interrupt (MTIMER) is configured to trigger periodically. Upon each timer interrupt, an interrupt service routine (ISR) is executed, enabling basic scheduling or periodic task execution. This serves as a foundational example for implementing preemptive multitasking, real-time control, and time-driven applications on a RISC-V system.
